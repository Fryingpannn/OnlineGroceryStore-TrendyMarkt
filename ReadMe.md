# Trendy Markt
## Website link: https://trendymarkt.herokuapp.com/
### Trendy Markt is a fully online and modern grocery store concept. This website was inspired by the recent social distancing circumstances and the move to online platforms.<br> It was made during my SOEN287 course project as a team of 6 people.

> Here are some of my responsibilities during this project:
> - Designed general website layout and grocery store concept
> - Created the index.php home page, signin.php, as well as the template for all aisle & product pages (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Fully responsive)
> - Created the entire login system: connected login, sign up and user list pages to allow showing/editing/deleting registered users as admin (MySQL, PHP (sessions))
> - Implemented user validation on various pages (Javascript (Event handling))
> - Deployed the website with remote database (on Google Firebase & Heroku (MySQL Workbench))
> - Lead the team: organized meetings, separation of tasks, structure of products and files, merged all files, helped teammates debug, testing, etc.
