# Trendy Markt
## Website link: https://trendymarkt.herokuapp.com/
#### Trendy Markt is a fully online and modern grocery store concept. This website was inspired by the recent social distancing circumstances and the move to online platforms. It was made during my SOEN287 course project as a team of 6 people.

#### Tech used: HTML/CSS/Boostrap/JavaScript/PHP/MySQL

> #### Here are some of my responsibilities during this project:
> - Designed general website layout and grocery store concept
> - Created the index.php home page, signin.php, as well as the template for all aisle (p2) & product pages (p3) (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Fully responsive)
> - Created the entire login system: connected login, sign up and user list pages to allow CRUD operations when logged in as admin (MySQL, PHP)
> - Implemented user validation on various pages (Javascript event handling)
> - Deployed the website with remote database (on Google Firebase & Heroku (MySQL Workbench))
> - Lead the team: organized meetings, separation of tasks, structure of products and files, merged all files, helped teammates debug, testing, etc.

Note: Since this was my first website made, yes we completely violated the 'DRY' principle and the code isn't exactly good.
